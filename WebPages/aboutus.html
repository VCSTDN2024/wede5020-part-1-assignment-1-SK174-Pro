            <h3>Our History</h3>
            <p>
                AlgoFlow is a South African NPO targeting young-minded individuals still in secondary school. 
                We provide access to coding, algorithmic, and problem-solving skills through workshops aligned with 
                tertiary NQF study levels. This helps learners get a glimpse of tertiary study materials, fostering 
                interest in technology and computer science faculties.
            </p>
            <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
            <p>
                AlgoFlow prepares young secondary school learners for real-world technology challenges. 
                We provide easy-to-follow courses that introduce students to tech concepts without affecting 
                their current studies, sparking interest in future opportunities.
            </p>
            <h3>Vision Statement</h3>
            <p>
                Our vision is to nurture young minds interested in IT and technology-related studies. 
                AlgoFlow enables learners to understand technology from a basic level through digital literacy 
                and computational skills, preparing them for the potential workforce environment.
